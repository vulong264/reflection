How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	Staging area acts as a middle step between work-in-progress and stored files. It's a set of ready-to-be-submitted-to-repository files. 
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	I would add only the changed file that is neccessary to make the logical change in the functionality of the final product
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
	Where I want to go with new idea that might not have a good final functional effect for the "main product"
	Where there are huge changes required to perform one logical change (maybe a demo feature) but the current main product must remain intact
