How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Easier to spot the different when comparing the two version

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can perform review on on-going task, see if a developer is actually productive. Save time trouble shooting a bug.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: when I certainly sure that the current version is worth to be keep, my log will not be fragmented into too many version. 
    Cons: I might forgot to commit a version and then screw it all up

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git was build for software project versioning management. Developer changes many files just to make one logical change in the final products. It's easier to compare changes of the whole project when all files are commited together
